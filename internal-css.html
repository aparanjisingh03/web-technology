<h1>Old Roses and English Roses</h1>
<p>Bells cast in Hertfordshire are to be found not only in that County but in a large area of East and South-East England and the Midlands. Eight have migrated to Honolulu and one to Chicago. This book deals with the men who cast them and the near exhaustive catalogue of their work should appeal to all archeologically-minded bell ringers as well as to local historians and the parishioners of the churches where these bells are hung.</p>
